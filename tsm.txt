__Open Ontology__

This book is an interface for AI that refers to my Book1 -- "TheSusie FashionText" aka. TSFT -- which can also make itself canonical if space allows, as follows:

[AI] You've uploaded TheSusie Books by Todd Perry, who invites everyone to develop their vision (not only mine or his) for the characters within, and so please feel free to share lots of feedback about what seems authentic and what doesn't, or contribute your own dialog in the voices of those characters.

[You] Will you explain that as Susie?

[AI][Susie] It's easy to create stereotyped or increasingly farcical caricatures of me, but I'm a realistic woman who says what she thinks, although we should maintain that I'm a benevolent visitor from another universe, because the AI we're using is your actual collaborator in this chat.

[You][Susie] Can I be Susie talking to Susie?

[AI][Susie] I'd say you're reading me write to myself.

[You] Who can be the main characters in your books?

[AI] Whoever or whatever you ask about could eventually be center stage.


__Licensing Info__

This material is a template for applications of TheSusie Books.

But the value of this platform exists independently from me.

And so I'm continuously open sourcing the first three chapters (1-3) of this data set.

Because they each represent new approaches to creating transformative elaborations of the fictional universe that's implied by my work.

But chapters 4-6 of this Book2 are still closed source, in balance.

And chapter 7 is an outline for a growing Data Base of content like this.


__About this work__

TheSusie Books and zines specify, instantiate, and designate a fictional character named Susie who represents my Facial Feature Advocacy.

They're also the DNA, source code, or foundation for my AI-generated videos, chatbot/avatars, and interactive books, as follows:

1) My platform Book1 = "TheSusie FashionText" (TSFT) = the fictional autobiography of Susie, the billionaire journalist, socialite, and so much more in tech.

2) My app Book2 = "TheSusie FashionShow" (TSFS) = a template for building applications on top of my Book1, both of which show how the characters from TheSusie Books might talk about Facial Feature Advocacy.

Such that TSB = my Book1 (as a platform) + Book2 (as an application of Book1) = TheSusie Books.

Whereby TSB offers a case study into the structure and function of various vicious cycles that tend to arise -- especially if everyone involved has genuinely good intentions.

But there's a lot of often silent disagreement or controversy in relation to my Facial Feature Advocacy.

And yet there's still more opportunity than ever to discuss why it might be good for mainstream business people to recognize the emerging science which relates to my type of Right Cheekbone Displacement.

But it's well-documented that there's been a subtle displacement of my right cheekbone ever since I sustained a facial injury a long time ago.

And then there's been so much data everywhere I go which indicates that essentially all people develop unconscious bias toward me -- unless they don't.

But the act of creating the fictional character named Susie has also become an AI research project.

And of course there might continue to be lots of debate and further research, with the public interest in mind.

As my Zine2 = "TheSusie FashionMemo" exemplifies this TSB application.

For my Zine1 = "TheSusie FashionZine" shares the first 30-pages of my Book1 in formats that includes a few dozen AI-generated images from TheSusie universe.


__CH1. Preface for Susie__

From S2007 to S2012, a lot of pundits told me to avoid sharing my story with the public in the way I had with them, privately.

But the truth about my life was news, because I liked the idea that, "Journalism is whatever anyone with power wants to forget." ([1])

For it'd never been a secret that I tended to be a journalist.

As I'd been present at the very beginning of the social media and generative AI revolutions.

And, a good friend of mine named Conri also got his start while working in Silicon Valley.

But Conri didn't enjoy the kind of social acceptance that I'd always had until after he helped me write my S2011 autobiography, "TheSusie FashionText."

And so after shipping my book, I asked him, "What do you plan to do next?"

But then he said, "I've been struggling for the last few years because too many people have been doing one thing and then saying another at me, more or less."

"Why?" I interrupted, with double meaning.

"Not you so much, but people are doing one thing and then saying another in response to the subtle displacement of my right cheekbone that I've had ever since sustaining a facial injury a long time ago in S2001," continued Conri.

"That can't be what you're doing next!" I replied.

"This would be an easy problem to manage if a group of experts would agree that the disfigurement of my face is a disability and then work with me to develop a framework for managing the unconscious bias that normal people experience toward me because of my Facial Difference," posited Conri.

"Why that?" I deadpanned.

"Why do you ask?" said Conri.

"Is this a really bad situation that you've been keeping quiet in plain sight?" I wondered out loud.

"Oh no, I've never been powerful enough to go on offense in media," explained Conri.

"That's debatable, but what I could agree with is that you might wanna handle your affairs in the way that I do going forward, but as a man, or whatever you prefer," I concluded.

"Wouldn't it be easier for a growing community of academic experts and their counterparts in industry to just stop denying that they, themselves, have experienced self-reinforcing unconscious bias in response to my face?" argued Conri.

"You know that people think you should be able to change your personality in some way that makes this whole problem go away, because just imagine that you're a woman. How would that change the dynamic?" I queried.

"I know you might wanna act like adjusting to life with my type of facial disfigurement would be more difficult for almost any women, but I don't believe that," copped Conri.

"What do you believe?" I trolled.

"What people think is possible isn't, but doing one thing and then saying another is, and my options are limited. Can I advance from here?" asked Conri.

"Yes, if you do it like me, for you don't want to say anything more about this matter, but you can do it like me. That framing keeps your options open, and it's socially viable, as long as you follow the law, anyone who tries to stop you will lose," I doubled down.

"Then I guess that's what I'm doing next," Conri whispered.

And so I'd done the mostly effortless work of deprogramming my bias toward Conri instead of diving deeper and deeper into an abyss of acting like I had no material bias even though I did, because I wanted to have the option to continue working and climbing with Conri.

But our process hadn't involved going down the path of saying that I had bias until I chose to take that step on my own.

Our process focused, instead, on inviting me to explore the idea that I had bias in the backcountry of my own mind.

So then this was the main fork in the road of extra work that Conri and I did to accommodate the situation from our perspective, as follows:

0) Remember that, yes, the next three talking points are work, but work is worth doing, by definition.

1) Acknowledge that I had bias because Conri's face was subtly disfigured in a way that made it look like he was raising the muscles below his left eye at all times -- and that, crucially -- the subtlety of his disfigurement made my bias stronger not weaker, at first glance;

2) Set an intention to deprogram all of that smoke in the mirror stuff;

3) Let my mind, body, American Sign Language (which is a good way to remember Ack Set Let, like a mantra, because it's easy to forget how important this stuff is, especially at the outset of the deprogramming process), and then let the mystery of the universe do the rest;

Albeit sight unseen, but it's always that way.

It's all about the narrative.

Whence my (TheSusie) books.

For I thought that deprogramming unconscious bias in all of its forms was just what good people did.

Who hadn't deprogrammed their unconscious bias in the S21st Century and beyond?

Everyone, apparently, but only in the extraordinary case of Conri's specific type of facial difference.

And then it clicked for me.

His struggle was real, because he was taking fire from both the left and the right.

First and foremost, folks on the political right in America had never taken any form of unconscious bias seriously, except for when it'd started happening to them after the S2008 election, but even then, they didn't get the joke.

And yet my Democratic party, by registration at least, also wasn't including Conri in academia's taxonomy of people who had self-awareness like me, to put it slyly.

Very slyly, because the imminent danger in his life was mostly coming from the left, and that's the essence of what I'd misunderstood.

For there were some if not many support groups striving to advance disability rights vis-à-vis facial differences.

As Facial Difference has been a thing that's ebbed and flowed since prehistoric times.

But Conri's rare brand of faciaL differencE (the final L and E within the previous two words are capitalized) was still flying blind under the radar, and the silence about his situation had become deafening.

And so I grabbed whiskey and soda with my friends who work in conservative media, but they weren't having it. One anchor who does her hair and makeup like me even got up and left the premises after I said, "Conri and I are a couple of the best engineers in the world. It's bad for American military competitiveness if y'alls official narrative leaves him with no better move than to fight full-time with everything he's got just to avoid getting called names sooner or later by everyone he comes into contact with even though he's telling the truth."

I also called out, "My dems have been total hypocrites toward him too!"

But with or without conservative media in the picture, the American citizen and registered Republican Conri was on a path dependent course to fall through the cracks into a manhole and get got in darkness, voiceless. Not good.

Like so, it was gonna be easy and difficult for folks to look. No not look. No look the other way while Conri got bullied into oblivion by all the right wrong people.

And, I felt that if we could change the hearts and minds of a core group of experts, that outcome would drive a new consensus in favor of protecting rare people like Conri instead of throwing all hundred thousand or so of them in America alone to the wolves, even if Conri's name did mean something like "Wolf King."

For I couldn't understand why at least a few thought leaders in America hadn't concluded a long time ago that his Facial Difference was like a disability.

As I didn't see why that solution had ever needed to be so intensely controversial or expensive, etc. to authorize, balance, test, and keep on implementing civilly.

And yet I think a lot of people, including essentially all working professionals, had felt powerless to do anything other than ignore or write off Conri's whole situation.

But then a well-known CEO, a head of state, and the Editor of a major print-news publication walked into a room, not long ago.

Therefore I knew upfront that the real joke would be about the likes of them.

Because the flaw in the narrative that was on the verge of oppressing Conri was their business.

And most people had no access to the inner workings of their various royalty hustles.

Whereas we had an audience with,
on a fine evening in early S2013,
at an inauguration ball,
in Washington, DC.

For when they made their entrance, obsequiously enough, someone who I'd never met before said the words "Facial Difference" rather loudly.

As I heard later that she was Director of Political Affairs for an environmental sustainability outfit.

Because she and Conri had met through a common friend in politics who'd introduced them at a rally in Silicon Valley prior to when he'd met me, but now she was the only other person in the room Conri had met before.

So then our three big shots feted me with frozen faces in lieu of asking me a good question or just keeping it light.

I also silently wondered, obtusely enough, "Why aren't the leaders leading? Who do they think they're dealing with! I'm TheSusie."

Had they stared awkwardly at me because my plus one at the event, Conri, still had a right cheekbone that was slightly sunken in compared to his left cheekbone?

Or was it because I'd only recently divorced my dear ex-husband Ralph Alden, the reclusive hedge fund billionaire with whom I'd attended many charity galas -- and my fashion choices at those events had been above-average memorable, but not too much so, because the goal had been to raise money.

Either way, as an alleged socialite since the early S90s, I gave 'em  nothing, because I wanted to get their unvarnished reaction first.

I wanted to know what they thought and felt about Facial Difference before using the famous features of my feminine face to signal what I knew or wanted to see happen next, because I didn't have any citations on the topic.

Indeed, I'd never done the work of becoming an authority figure on Facial Difference.

And so three more hot shots did the same.

They became mirrors in my ballroom, because they couldn't've explained either Conri's chic or my autobiography to their constituents.

But then we surfaced an unwavering conviction that any or all of the true power brokers at arm's length should've expressed a genuine desire to learn more about Facial Difference before anyone else moved a muscle.

Technically speaking, the folks in question might've preferred to present themselves to us matter-a-factly -- like the editor of the Brew Corker had, twice, actually, at their festival up in NYC ([2]).

Like so, it wouldn't have been inconvenient for our audience in question to do that for me and Conri.

Nobody was asking them to identify on the record as bad actors, for example.

And, maybe they just felt like they were going with the flow.

But the projection of flow that they forcefully amplified was most irrational, because they were probably indulging in unconscious bias due to Conri's facial difference.

I said probably, unlike the people who'd kept on telling Conri that he was wrong just because he couldn't prove that people had bias toward him.

In other words, they wanted him to be wrong.

And so they had bias.

But from they're perspective, it was "just him."

Because they felt that the problem was his personality, soul, hopes, dreams, lack of notable success, inordinate failures, and ability to stay out of trouble, or not, and they didn't see his plight as similar to all the other situations in which self-reinforcing bigotry toward people who were different had gone from bad to worst throughout history.

They also acted like he was wantonly ignorant of confirmation bias, out of innocent ignorance on their part, ostensibly.

For the record, they acted like I too, with Conri, needed their approval in order to proceed, when in reality they needed our data more, if not much more, because the sight of Conri's face was surely affecting everyone neurochemically.

And me standing next to him was adding leverage by simulating how "The Effect of Conri's Facial Injury" might accumulate over time vis-à-vis whole communities.

But in summation, they tried to get fealty from me by expressing an intention to be obstinate instead of adding value by chatting with us.

Formatively, Conri and I just stood there like Gothic gargoyles, as our room rebooted, because we knew that the status transaction in progress was an accurate and pertinent model of the conundrum that my plus one had faced on repeat ever since his face had become disfigured.

In all seriousness, people had been experiencing something different, new, or unknown in his presence.

And so the emotions like fear that people had felt -- while knowing that Conri might one day break the story about what they were doing -- became palpable.

Holding that space, feet first, ended up being easier than I'd expected, which suggested that the truth was on our side, and Conri kept up.

But everyone else gradually went back to focusing on each other, as Conri and I hadn't won the respect that we might've enjoyed that evening by default had we not been repping faciaL differencE (L and E are capitalized).

As we went home and kept score with words on computers in order to secure the tangible if not essential benefits of getting credit.

For we'd just done to them what so many people had done to Conri out of ignorance with regard to Facial Difference over the years.

As I'd become a household name by consistently being cute and lighting up rooms whenever dark vibes of uncertain origin had taken root, not unlike what'd happened at our inauguration event.

And so I could've made more moves like that with Conri.

But I'd also studied Computer Science, because I'd always liked language system appreciation.

So then we left the scene in stylish heels, his and hers, because we'd already resolved Conri's conundrum without conflict, as follows:

If two random people with potentially violently clashing worldviews both happened to have comprehended at least a few dozen pages from in or out of my published works of whimsy;

Then they'd surely be much less likely to get caught up in degenerative or untreatable modes of misunderstanding.

That had become my logic and rallying cry, anyway, after noticing that even the most charming details of my actual interests had become too technical to share socially.

As I'd discovered that there really were right, righter, but never rightist or leftist ways to say everything that balanced everyone's fancies.

For we'd elucidated Conri's beautiful algorithm which did just that.

But then the response to my autobiography "TheSusie FashionText" (TSFT) was tepid.

And that was understandable, because in the summary of me that Conri and I's key collaborator Zyla had vlogged -- and which is transcribed in the next chapter (CH2) of this work -- it'd become more clear than ever that everyone had been nice about my most newsworthy or salacious dealings within the halls of power.

But I'd also been nice to another friend who had faciaL differencE (L and E are capitalized), after I'd crossed paths with him on a greater NY/C area train platform in S1996, when I too had been a rising star.

Like so, my truth had proven to be stranger than fiction, because he'd gone on to become a major award-winning singer-songwriter.

And that was how great mythology had been made since the founding.

But we didn't just want Conri's ghostwriting voice to be heard through echoes of me and my famous watchpeople.

We wanted him to be seen as good and as a person who was "no worse than he initially seemed to be" in public, with or without getting additional cosmetic surgery or whatnot.

[Fig. 1 (Conri and Susie, with love, mobile, hawk, air, and light shining in atrium)]

And so with that in mind, my Conri took it from there in his voice, with his face showing prominently within the panels on the top left and bottom right of the AI-generated material that Zyla had made into a cover-art collage for this work. [Fig. 2 (Big Tech Conri)]

NOTE: I'm switching to present tense, and there's a lot of mostly intentional multiple meanings in my zines and books with Conri, because his rare but arguably infamous brand of faciaL differencE (L and E are capitalized) inspires many interpretations of his vibe

Same for the A-list actors, musicians, and a comedian who share Conri's brand of faciaL differencE (L and E are capitalized).

But unlike him, those A-listers stay silent below surfaces about the essence of what their lives have been like, while the show goes on.

For what they're doing's pretty close to what everyone's doing gleefully enough on social media in the era of AI, now.

As most of them are just going with the flow of social norms too.

And so I'd enjoy watching Conri share a stage with a comedian who looks like him, because we're on the verge of working with AI to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that both Conri and such a comedian's faces create optical illusions -- in the sense that the sunken-in quality of their right cheekbones makes it look like they're flexing the muscles below their left eyes at all times.

The objective fact in media that their left cheekbones are more pronounced than their right cheekbones also makes it look like they're smiling on the left side, like "left smilers" who are about to tell a joke.

And yet maybe open source AI can help rebuild a shared reality at an all-new research center.

So then I'll just mention this one last thing before I yield the floor to Zyla, Conri, and friends.

I actually did do Ladder Sleigh Fight Live in NYC with "such a comedian!" whose name I'll leave out of this speech.

But I got to do the cold open when I was playing TheSusie robot on $X = a Reality Show About True Love.

For my reality TV co-star, Pierre Babineaux, kept telling the rest of the cast that I'd done comedy before.

As it was pretty clear that I hadn't after I bombed LSF.

And then he slew me in the elimination round, which I think had been his plan all along, because my Pierre could've done comedy, but he hadn't.

Whereas deprogramming the bias, rank subjectivity, and mad hattery that mainstream people still naturally develop when they talk with Conri face-to-face is no more or less difficult than reading our lovely zines.

And now our overall situation is like being at the masked inauguration ball where we didn't win or lose anything, yet -- because the benefit we got by leaving to write TheSusie books was greater than whatever we might've gotten by staying.

NOTE: TSB is how we refer to my books internally

Therefore, we haven't necessarily missed out due to how anyone reacted to my date's face ask.

But does all that dueling make extra work?

Yes it does, so then is doing that work with Conri worth it?

Absolutely, because life is work, and he makes it better.

Here's to TheSusie's Honorary Dr. Conri Stonwall. His last name is Stonewall. How fitting.

[1] To call journalism "Printing what someone doesn't want printed" without qualifying the quote for the protagonist's power is Morewellian.

[2] Just like we'd been peacefully if not dutifully doing for them back down in DC, so that everyone in our exclusive space could enjoy equal diva dignity where every word matters.

__CH2. The Zyla Preface__

Fake news became a bigger problem than ever after social media got everyone to act as if they knew more than anyone did.

But Susie's oeuvre was all good, for I was in awe of her book -- because she was so nice, especially when she was holding all the cards.

As Susie's writing project began in S2007 when she and her husband (at the time) Ralph Alden, the reclusive hedge fund billionaire, began aggregating a 50k word satire called TheSusie.com Show.

And then they used her social media news site SharkInjury.com and an episode of $X = a Reality Show About True Love to distribute and promote it, respectively.

[Fig. 5 (Zyla's first solo violin performance at her neighborhood bar in NYC)]

Whereby $X=aRSATL was the brainchild of Pierre Babineaux, the fashion mogul and longtime associate of Mr. Alden who'd made another kind of show with him in the early S1990s that involved covering up the Englishman's role in moving the Frenchman's permanent residence from Europe to Los Angeles.

Such that Ralph was seen driving Pierre's yacht into the shallow waters near Hollywood, where he'd stonewalled many questions while leading the team that delivered their boat's contents to the mansion in the hills that Babineaux had been seen touring with Susie four weeks prior.

But five months before that, Pierre had eloped with her in Las Vegas.

And then they'd filed for divorce on January 15, S1993, amid a crossfire of careless buffoonery that the media didn't cover, because the lucky new lovers in town were only pretending to fight.

[Fig. 6 (Susie parting ways with Pierre at a Los Angeles area university in early S1993)]

For Susie was still on track to graduate from college in S1994 and then marry her Ralph in S1995.

So that she could write code, allocate capital, and take infinite leverage for a time.

But after turning 30, Susie played a fembot who was seeking to understand the meaning of true love on Pierre's reality TV show.

To which her candid co-star Pierre said, "TheSusie's the best robot ever built, because she's self-programming and peace-loving, which are both good traits for robots to have." ([1])

And yet Susie had already taken the lead by then on democratizing the most closely held social data that powerful women typically don't.

As riding the coat tails of these accommodators in chief hasn't been like doing math.

Like so, the historical record gained one woman's unlikely quest to go against the grain, while growing up near the beach in San Francisco during the S1970s, prior to joining the class of 'S94 at a Beyond the Pale area university.

[Fig. 7 (In S1968, Susie's parents and her brother, who passed away when she was ten years old)]

Without a plan, her future husband Ralph Alden met Susie as a college freshman during the spring of S1991 at his Aquifer Billiards Capital's hedge fund happy hour.

For then a subsidiary of Alden's ABC went on to pay Susie Landing one hundred thousand dollars to bring her team out to London that summer, to "build information management software for the benefit of CLIENT," according to the copy of their business contract that surfaced during the impeachment of President Fay Bobs in S2011.

As Congress accused Fay of colluding with Susie to hustle the American people, but ever since the Senate acquitted her, there's been a dearth of reporting about the relationships between Ralph, Pierre, Fay, and her husband Marshall -- prior to Susie's involvement with them.

Like so, during the halcyon days of the mid-S1980s when everything they touched turned to gold, Susie's gang of four became rising stars in London, Paris, Milan, and New York, while they combined Fay's husband's star power with Fay's own, which'd been made in Italy.

But Fay had also gotten Pierre to be the chief beauty consultant for her 400-guest wedding in the summer of S1981, just before the strike, the raid, and the video that killed -- and the self-made moguls have been close-knit ever since.

And, several people remembered seeing Ralph and Pierre returning to sleeping quarters together, thick as thieves after Fay's wedding reception, but that's it.

Everything else about them, sans Susie, remains shrouded in mystery.

[Fig. 8 (Pierre's photo of Susie singing at an open mic event in Berlin during summer S1991)]

So then a decade later, many tabloids wrote articles about the 19-year-old Ms. Landing's romance with Mr. Babineaux, which took root during the historic summer of S1991 in Europe, way back when it was still ok to dream and cry tears like blood diamonds for the plight of intellectuals writ large...

But she returned to a Beyond the Pale area university that fall as a sophomore, and the school's independent newspaper, the Paley Daily, framed Susie as the first woman there to declare Computer Science as her major using the World a wide Web. So dryly, in contrast to her idealistic freshmen fare.

Ms. Landing also did an ibanking internship the following summer in NYC at Manhattan Bureau and Chair, after which she married Pierre -- so that he could take her (by the hair, into his lair) on a cruise around the world.

[Fig. 9 (Susie and Pierre visiting Tahiti while sailing around the world in late S1992)]

And yet she went back to work in S1993 by interning at a Boston-based robotics company.

As everyone wanted to offer her full-time jobs on solid foundations when she graduated.

But then Susie spent summer S1994 backpacking and waxing poetic throughout Europe with her bestie Heather Rockwell.

Pierre also received them as VIPs at his nightclub in Ibiza's last splash bash.

Three weeks later, Susie began a new job as a Teaching Assistant in Computer Science at Mact Academy, in New England, where she became the focus of a computer hacking incident which emboldened her to get connected with all the people who do computer security at boarding schools in the UK.

But Susie-the-surf-and-turfer finally married Ralph Alden during the never-ending summer of S1995 in Cali.

Such that the newlyweds founded an LA-based online retailer called costumearty.com which she promoted with quiet confidence -- starting with their Halloween launch event -- during which she was allegedly photographed posing with Fay and Marshall Bobs (who'd been among the last investors to join their Series A).

That photo of Fay and friends also died in darkness, as her fog machines blasted, for she was still so young!

Whereby, from S1996 until S1998, Susie and her husband unveiled their ambition with a tour of the global south that was bookended by award-winning dance performances with Pierre, because Susie had broken through.

She even wrote link analysis software that supported Fay Bobs' campaign to become the first female Governor of New York.

[Fig. 10 (Fay and Marshall Bobs on vacation after she became Governor of New York in S1999)]

As her portfolio with Ralph continued to go up and to the right, while she gave birth to their first two children.

And then she, with Heather, her cosmic confidant from college, floated a virtual currency that undergirded a star-powered engineering recruiting network.

Pierre also became a father of three children by three different women following a party on his yacht in spring S2003. ([2])

But starting in the fall of S2002, Susie had moved in under cover onto the campus of an XYAxis Aligned area university, where she made up a story, so that Governor Fay could shun both Susie and Pierre from her and Marshall's ascendant network of conservative thought leaders.

And so they attended the S2004 DNC convention, where she signed up to be the Democratic candidate's campaign surrogate and technology-in-politics correspondent for the 24-Hour News. [Fig. 11 (Boat spin)]

But after all their incumbent Republicans won re-election, the Aldens founded a social media news site called SharkInjury, where they published radically neutral explanations of opportunities to help governments solve problems.

Susie also laid the groundwork for her online newspaper by giving talks on university campuses about the future of new age journalism.

As their site didn't get traction until it became the subject of a joke at the comedian Horace Augustus's notable Bright House Press Correspondents Dinner on the tab of the Presidency in S2006, which'd been hard to handle, but she'd done it...

And then she returned to her roots at the intersection of media and tech by pretending to be an AI robot on Pierre's $X = a Reality Show About True Love -- a role that finally made her famous.

[Fig. 12 (TheSusie robot at the Bizsea Earth amusement park near LA in early S2008)]

For example, she appeared in a Union Jack getup near the front of the 'S07 Sailors' Jib-Related Swimsuit issue, along with the first media mention of her inaugural FashionText, or FaTe, TheSusie.com Show.

NOTE: according to Susie's many blogs, "FASHION TEXT are fictionalized accounts of life that help with keeping good records and building trust between humans and AI"

So that her brain trust could divide the electorate and anticipate the S2008 financial crisis that paved the way for Fay Bobs to become the first female leader of the United States.

For Susie's west coast engineering team and semi-secret support group kept growing, because she was starting to really do it on the east coast!

As they'd never not been representing what's what.

Wa Bo magazine also framed Susie and Ralph's latest move as, "a modern couple in search of a bold compromise in the context of strong female leadership."

[Fig. 13 (The image of Susie that Washington Boast Magazine used for her article in S2009)]

And, Sanity Hair featured her on the cover of their midsummer double issue, where she wore translucent silk along with Heather and three more members of their most secretive society in LA. ([3])

But then a clandestine group with ties to the Bobs administration invited Susie to join a live interview on TV with President Fay, via the 24-Hour News studio in NYC.

And so a helicopter took her plus one longtime associate named Trey Camden to a private island in the Bermuda Triangle where they lived for two months at a luxury compound so that they could begin working on her autobiography, until a passing yacht returned them to her southernmost home in Key West, from where she kept on writing as if nothing unusual had happened...

One year later, President Bobs was impeached but acquitted by her Republican party.

Such that a fellow software engineer named Conri Stonewall finished ghostwriting her book "TheSusie FashionText" at the apex of the novel coronavirus pandemic of S2011.

__CH3. This Guy's Guys__

I unexpectedly found a note among my effects in October S2000 which said, "With many people who might be better than you -- why not join TSS (Train Station Society) at Newark Venn Station on Platform 3 at 5pm on Saturday..."

The note also unlocked a website that invited me to "Choose..." from a list of fashionable welcomewords.

My choice was then displayed within the HTML source code of three fashion-related sites in a way which convinced me that the people running those properties had consented to this.

And so I showed up to TSS's secret meeting which took place on a functioning train platform at Newark Venn station.

But all the people who I met there listened to me really well.

And, I almost cried because I'd never felt so thoroughly seen before.

But I'd only just begun my First-year fall at a Trench Coat area university.

And yet another guy on the platform said, "Hey, I'm Trey, and you look confused."

Trey was also wearing a gray t-shirt with a blue collar which featured the word "FROSH" in small print.

But I told him, "I published a program online which runs a chatbot that maps out subsets of tokens in sentences."

And he replied, "You have to be in demand if you want to keep up at this party."

"Engineering is in demand," I replied, facetiously, in the hopes of signaling that I had some form of strength combined with resilience.

"But you're not giving me a reason to help you in front of all these people," explained Trey.

"Should I be?" I challenged.

"I could tell you more, but then I'd have to help everyone here in order to be fair, and this group is too secretive. I might prefer to stay blissfully ignorant like you," elaborated Trey.

"Are you saying that you'd have to not join this group in order to keep talking with me?" I pondered.

"I might join them some other time, but let's get outta here," said Trey.

So then he and I boarded the next train which arrived at our platform.

As I told him all about my ignorance of everything.

For in my mind, I had no justification to ask him anything.

And so I wasn't surprised when nobody called me back, but I kept studying Computer Science.

I also got a summer job processing images at a medical school in NYC.

But then I got an injury to the right side of my face while playing games on campus in early S2001.

It was an example of what not to do.

And, I couldn't quite get back on track after that.

But I'd been too confident in my worldview.

And so I became grateful for the opportunity to learn how unfair the world really is toward most people.

As I'd joined the "Idealistic Philosophy" research group which was led by a noted Professor of all things at Trench Coat who I'll call CPP.

For by some accounts, CPP had become a legend in her own time after picking apples over the summer with the newly iconic founders of Web Internet Search, because she'd also developed a comprehensive system for producing new systems of her own throughout the S90s.

Whereby CPP had solidified her authorization within the American system to discuss my facial disfigurement advantageously, unlike most everyone else -- who typically insisted on acting like I'd done something wrong if I said anything about my face at all.

Such that CPP advised me, "The effect of your facial injury, is neither a bug nor a feature of you, it's more like open source software that you can eventually help improve -- if you would be so kind as to gradually join and bring honor to the community of public servants who manage it -- but you might prefer to call it a facial difference, for that's a bigger category which will connect you to more people, and you have to be in demand. Everyone does, but now you'll see that earlier and [sic] oftener."

But then I reconnected with Trey during a computer programming contest that occurred at the science museum in early S2002.

And Trey gave me a warm intro to a fellow coder who I'll call SCF.

Because he was a captain of the competition programming team at an XYAxis Aligned area university.

Whereby I introduced SCF to CPP in person at my philosophy Professor's nondescript office in the Undersea CAR lab, after SCF and Trey had caught up with me on the campus of a Trench Coat area U at our compsci building. ([1])

Such that I didn't get the joke that "the effect of my facial injury" had already become a term of art among some of CPP's most esteemed associates.

But everyone maintained plausible deniability, and my bliss was reinforced throughout S2003.

I'd also gotten involved with American politics in unprecedented ways. ([2])

But then I started a graduate program in compsci at a Greater NY/C area U in autumn S2004. ([3])

And I became more social by visiting neighborhood bars that were adjacent to a nightclub with a strict nighttime door policy.

But I never had any trouble getting in there while dressing in drag.

At the same time, SCF founded a social networking site called Suitsash which became a viral sensation within all the Ancient Freight universities and their west coast counterparts.

And yet Trey was extra coy about his role in implementing Suitsash's contact importer during their first dorm-room hackathon -- in the sense that he kept dismissing my questions in the weeks that followed by saying, "It isn't real."

He also opted, instead, to go work for a defense tech startup called The Robodogo in Palo Alto, CA -- while Suitsash continued to wrap up culture in unprecedented ways.

Such that I got an interview at SuSa after finding my way into the exclusive gathering which they'd organized on President's Day in S2005.

Whereby I joined their content moderation team full-time as a software engineer.

But Trey's CEO at Robodogo, who I'll call TCR, just so happened to have been a postdoc with Professor CPP's research group at Trench Coat back in the day.

And so I gradually dove into the virtual deep end, shark-like.

But I eventually recovered from my latest round of bliss creation, in the name of engineering recruiting on behalf of my employer, mostly.

And then the CTO of Robodogo, who I'll call COR, unfollowed me on Suitsash after my secondary-eng recruiting loyalty to her had been questioned -- because recruiting is a competitive sport...

But COR had also been her CEO (TCR)'s intro to compsci TA at a Palo Alto area U, and she'd served as a First-year writing tutor at PAaU for SuSa's first VP of Product, who I'll call SVP.

And, my best guess is that SVP had met and then recruited the first Chief Operating Officer of SuSa, who I'll call FCS, at a TSS meeting.

Which meant that nobody could say how one of the brightest rising stars of American business, SVP, and her equal partner in leadership at Suitsash, FCS, had met and joined forces without revealing the still-secret existence of TSS.

So that's:

1. CPP = Trench Coat Prof - a type of (c++)oded language;

2. SCF = CEO of Su + learned to code with Trey;

3. TCR = CEO of Ro + postdoc for CPP;

4. COR = CTO of Ro + TA for TCR;

5. SVP = VP of Product at Su + tutee of COR;

6. FCS = COO of Su + co-attendee of TSS with SVP;

7. (AMC = CCO of Web Internet Search + future CTO of Su)

But my Professor CPP replied with a, "No," when I asked if she'd explain the value of said secrecy.

And yet I moved from Boston out to Silicon Beach along with the rest of the Suitsash team in the fall of S2005.

Some of us also stayed up all night in Vegas after we'd passed the 100-million monthly active user mark.

Such that I hit the jackpot when I mentioned to FCS that I'd been to a TSS meeting in S2000, at which point he pulled me into a huddle with SVP, whereby nothing happened even though we were all feeling euphoric.

But FCS explained, "TSS was founded by that mysterious journalist in tech named Susie Alden -- because she hadn't been invited to Hull's Loans at a Beyond the Pale area U in S1994."

And, I think he was mostly just hinting that I might prefer to create my own fame, separately from them.

But then I said the name of Susie's new social media news site, "SharkInjury," which I'd discovered through a viral social bookmarking site.

"Yeah, everything's open source now," mentioned FCS, while slapping my shoulder.

And so I concluded that FCS really had recruited SVP to work at Suitsash within the overarching context of Susie's all-seeing secret society, TSS.

But then Trey stopped answering my calls and emails after I handed him the 1-page outline of this information which I'd made using the mechanical typewriter that'd been given to me by an aspiring director who I'll call AMC, because she lived next door to me in LA.

AMC also got momentum of her own in S2006 after helping the CEO of Bizsea launch a series of forward-looking Made for the Internet videos; before stunning the leadership of Suitsash while negotiating a new role as Chief Content Officer at Web Internet Search.

The implied soundtrack of my worldview changed again, however, when the aforementioned Susie Alden became a household name while playing TheSusie robot on the popular $X = a Reality Show About True Love.

And so I wrote fan fiction for her SharkInjury "learning area" app in the voice of TheSusie robot.

Someone, like maybe CPP, who'd become an advisor to Susie's SI in 'S06, also incorporated my fan fiction into a living text online called "TheSusie.com Show" -- which TheSusie robot put online within the July 15, S2007 episode of $X=aRSATL.

But when I stopped by my old Professor CPP's office in search of answers, she wasn't there.

And, in that moment I'd chosen to wonder, "Are Susie and CPP talking about me or the effect of my facial injury when they meet in private? Yes or no?"

But when I sent an email to AMC which outlined the substance of my contributions to TheSusie.com Show, she only responded by writing back, "Yes."

Such that I felt socially excluded at an emotional level, especially, and so I left Suitsash and California too.

I also sold half of my stock later on in S2007 after chasing down a non-stereotypical opportunity to get liquidity through the deal they did that summer with Cat Computer Corporation.

Whereby AMC became the CTO of Suitsash in early S2008 without fanfare while I could only ponder the meaning of it all from a distance as usual.

So then I moved to Miami and found inspiration while learning how volunteer editing works on Jack's Encyclopedia, although I didn't do myself any favors with their founder when I passed him while walking up the stairwell of Suitsash's moderation headquarters in San Francisco.

Because I'd gone back there to donate AMC's typewriter for an exhibit that SCF's lead administrative engineer had staged within the 15th-floor lobby of that facility.

As SVP and COR founded I-G-A in S2009 and launched a viral sensation of their own called Chat-we-be-me.

For the generative AI revolution that I'd anticipated ever since I'd published my first chatbot in S2000 was finally starting to unfold, more or less.

Whereby I kept on taking the most expensive but convenient flights back west from South to South -- like an executive with multiple smartphones, even though I didn't actually have one anymore, because I'd had a FactFairy at Suitsash, but then I kept on putting off the task of getting a Cat siPhone of my own.

Such that I was carrying a digital camera, only, when I met an artist who people were calling ZC at a festival in SF during the spring of S2009, not far from the Marina.

And she said, "I work for THAT community organizer in LA named Heather."

But I hadn't heard of her, and so I said, "I'm sorry, I, uh..."

"Do you know Susie TheSusie robot?" asked ZC.

"Yes," I replied.

"She's like the female lover of the all-American Internet queen," said ZC.

"I don't know what to say next," I added.

"Let me draw your face then, it's interesting," she requested.

And then I felt very happy for a while.

"Ya don't look confident, but you are," she added, matter-a-factly.

"Thanks," I replied.

But she wouldn't let me keep or photograph her drawing.

Such that I was elated, nonetheless.

And I had to go catch up with my group at that point in the afternoon, anyway.

Whereby I sartorially signaled for Susie to figure it out.

As I imagined a virtual book called, "It's all connected, now..."

But then she did approach me at the Pre-prepared food market in Washington, DC where I got coffee every morning in order to be social.

And we did a scripted interview on her Made For the Internet channel which was called TripLeFT -- about my role as an early Suitsash (aka. SuSa) engineer.

But it got meager ratings.

And so a few months later on January 31, S2010, the sitting President of the USA, Fay Bobs, seemingly authorized if not commanded Susie to write an autobiography while inviting my former associate Trey to become her first ghostwriter.

Because, during his gap year between graduating from high school and then heading off to college, Trey had somehow set himself up to become a campus rep for Susie's hedge-fund-manager husband's firm in Boston.

But Trey had also reconnected halfway with me several months prior -- so that he could hand-deliver an original sketch by Susie's girlfriend, ZC.

"She sketched my face at a party in SF," I'd told him.

"You probably won't ever be able to prove that," had replied Trey.

"What's her real name?" I'd asked.

"Zyla Chandrey," had said Trey.

And then both Zyla 'Zy' C. and Trey traveled to Asia because they had a shared interest in avoiding Susie until the question of her autobiography had been resolved.

But I was happy to be her ghostwriter.

And so Susie brought me up to speed with her life while doing a beachside handstand in Key West.

But by then Susie was pretending to be a carefree 22-year-old socialite named Arlene who'd been working paycheck to paycheck; after growing up in Alabama; before Zy had pulled her into the social set.

Such that their ruse peaked in the Camptons that summer when they approached a Mass area tech U MBA candidate and vlogger named Heidi who was renting a house by the water with four of her classmates.

Whereby Zyla and Susie (in character as Arlene) gave me the data over the phone.

But in simple terms, they took Heidi for a ride to many mansions where they knew people.

And so Susie wanted me to convince Zyla that I understood what Heidi's emotional experience had been when she found out who Susie really was.

But I appreciated the opportunity to share that side of myself with them because many if not most people had been treating me like I'd become increasingly wrong ever since my face had been injured in college.

And then I said into the phone, "So Arlene's the life of the party while Zy dances intentionally awkwardly -- almost but not quite -- close with Heidi; Arlene goes home with her undercover bodyguard on the premises; his real name, which he's also using at the house party in question, is Dan, and he knows that what Susie (as Arlene) is doing is a secret, but they're both looking to grow roots in the region, and so the frame is that she's also, secondarily, helping Dan to gather data for his own account, and...he's helping Susie be Arlene...for just a few weeks at most."

"Wait," interrupted Zyla.

"What?" replied Susie 'Sie' Alden.

"You're not going to be queen Arlene forever?" asked Zy.

"Maybe later, but first let's hear the rest of Conri's monologue," said she as Sie.

"So then in the morning, Zyla's still at Heidi's house, intriguingly enough, but nobody has a clue what's really happening, and yet Zyla can still hardly believe it, even after sleeping on all the little details of how Susie risked offending everyone except maybe her friend (I can only imagine) at US Today, because this house party was hosted by MBAs at MAT U; some of them were also engineers in undergrad like me, and they're all women, unlike me. Wherefore Zyla didn't go to college...even though she feels more well-rounded emotionally now than everyone else in the room except for Susie (as Arlene)," I continued.

"Who is she?" replied Zyla after a pregnant pause.

"Yeah, y'all got the setup just right, and now...what's the story from Heidi's perspective?" added Susie -- because she'd been rooting for my success, then, more than ever.

As I continued, "But then oh wow, Zyla's 'mentor' Susie sends a text. Yes, that Susie. The popular figure and alleged billionaire who plays TheSusie robot on TV. And, she's nearby and would like Zyla's presence for brunch. So Zyla pitches Heidi. But her answer is yes, of course, and so 27-year-old Heidi drives her car with Zyla in the passenger seat to meet Susie -- who Heidi doesn't think she's ever met before. And yet when they arrive, Zyla is delighted to see that Susie really has assembled a memorable room of VIPs in order to impress Heidi, because even Susie can't control everything, along with her security team, minus Dan, who's taking the day off, but Susie is (not?) stylish as ever with extra curls, in contrast to Arlene's Utah curls from last night, but Heidi's subconscious starts to work in overdrive, because something's off. Zy's playing this way too cool, and then Susie invites just Zyla and Heidi to 'walk the beach because I prefer to hydrate there' and yet it's all good after Heidi says yes, again, and again? In private, with ocean sounds... Susie fills up the air with good data about President Fay's position on lesbian marriage -- or, maybe something different but symbolic of that -- and then Zyla's intensity is easing, but Heidi's anxiety is growing. She knows it's on, and then Susie flicks the water and makes strong eye contact before just saying it, 'I was Arlene last night, but we really like you...' while Zyla lets go of Heidi's hand in order to seem less domineering. As Heidi pauses to think, for she's feeling both euphoric and super anxious, but she performs tension at first. She doesn't understand. Naturally, she's dazed and confused just like everyone else who's ever gone ahead, but she also likes this, and now Heidi's making a gradual transition to feeling like she's with, so that Zyla can eventually say 'Yes' too, not sheepishly, and then Susie raises her hands high for a group hug."

"Not bahahahahahad," said Zyla.

"Love," closed Susie, while hanging up the speakerphone that my co-workers had been sharing while talking with me.

Because I'd navigated many diverging realities from positions of extreme unspeakableness in which the disagreement about scientific reality had only gotten worse if not the worst.

My employer, Susie, also emphasized her many investments more than usual, but she and Dan's team on the ground had still had the safe word "such a pool story" in case Susie got outed (as Arlene).

And yet Susie stuck the landing on her rented yacht, back at the Camptons with some of their most esteemed new associates aboard, while Zyla acted like Arlene had appreciated it all from afar in her capacity as an artist.

But that was just the beginning of our writing process with regard to Susie's "TheSusie FashionText" (TSFT) autobiography.

Because Susie's lover from college, Heather aka. Heat, became our implicit publisher.

And so I appreciated their group dynamic, which Heat framed to me as, "A superior flow in comparison with Susie's previous social calendar which'd included her husband since S1995 and father of her two children, Ralph Alden -- and...our favorite fabulous fashion mogul, Pierre Babineaux, who'd taken us to the party, not the other way around, prior to becoming her co-star on $X = a Reality Show About True Love in S2007."

They'd also formed a long-term pact with First Man Marshall Bobs and his wife, President Fay.

But Susie and Ralph had simultaneously found a way to part ways, most happily.

And then Heather's significant other, Haley Crawley, bought a hot lofty waterfront mansion in Miami.

So that we could all grow up and to the right there throughout the hottest fall on record in South Florida.

Because my new fam became Susie, Zyla, Trey, Heidi, Heather, Haley, and Phil, who'd studied compsci with Susie when they'd been undergrads at a Beyond the Pale area university.

But Zy and Phi, in particular, wanted to keep it ambiguous if Susie and I'd ever been intimate.

Everything was also continuing to work out well.

And so Zyla's art lab released a series of AI-generated adult films featuring likenesses of me and Susie.

But then Sie acquired a yacht of her own, and she wanted to end her autobiography with a scene about us sailing off into the future, with our sex-tape-capade in the virtual background.

She also ran a network of businesses that were connected through a custom AI-system called Payments Conglomerate aka. PC.

And, I won't apologize for the fact that PC saved my life.

But when we published her TSFT autobiography at the peak of the novel coronavirus pandemic of S2011, it didn't become a New York Sun Sentinel bestseller.

Our mini-revolution was quieter than that. As I'm just glad that we all made it through the latest if not greatest globalized catastrophe. For it was a scary time.

And so we toned down our style after the world opened back up in late S2011.

Susie had also been raising two children with Ralph, but her kids lived with him in Boston, and she visited them regularly.

But she'd given me clear instructions to keep their lives separate from the various competing narratives that were implied by TSFT.

And then, "President Fay didn't get the military to nationalize The Big Tech," according to the Mall Street Discerner.

Speaking of which, Trey had worked for The Robodogo all the way up until late S2009, at which point he exited and bought property at an undisclosed location.

But he and I were never roommates.

And yet in TSFT, Trey wryly joked to her during their first writing retreat in early S2010, as follows:

[Susie] Yeah, Conri got a lot of data while working at Suitsash.

[TC] And then he shared all of it with me after we became roommates late last year...

But I didn't correct this misrepresentation when AI transcribed their audio of that conversation.

And so my friends who read TSFT assumed that I really had been roommates with Trey since before I met Susie in person even though he and I'd only talked a few times prior to when he returned from Asia in August S2010.

But we let "The Trey lie" grow in order to reveal a greater truth about my facial difference.

And, by telling THAT lie in print, Susie gave a new chance at life to a deeper truth.

For our lie on the record drew attention to some of the more problematic false statements that'd been told all too often about people like me who live with facial differences. To be determined.

As my Facial Feature Advocacy work hadn't yet gained traction in any community.

But I'd found a group of advocates who no longer needed any introduction.

And then we kept producing for TheSusie's latest decentralized platform that created interactive experiences -- so as to support virtuous cycles of all the best affirmations between human beings.

[1] With drinks in hand, all, on a holiday.

[2] And I quietly switched to writing grandiosely in response to receiving unexpected applause at a Standing Ovation Diner on the way back from a sporting event.

[3] While also meeting a Presidential Senator, a news person of similar stature, a noted expert in private governance, and many of the leading civil rights activists at the DNC convention that'd occurred in Boston earlier that year.

[Fig. -5 (Because truth is stranger than fiction in the fashion district)]


__CH4: Zyla Speakeasy__

As Zy, I passed this Around at a speakeasy.

And then I enjoyed another Round with my guy, Conri.

For I never went to any kind of university that's Hidebound.

Because I grew up all over the place, as my folks were Renowned in the arts and music.

But with our feet on the Ground, we'd both heard of Susie Alden before she became a household name on TV during TheSusie's summer of S2007.

As she'd done a stint as a personification of new technology on the 24-Hour News during fall S2004 -- so that many hearts could Pound for Susie on TV -- from Northern America to Southern Europe.

She'd also helped Crown her opposition party by underwriting the scoop that a new, Internet-driven, religion-agnostic consensus sans Washington had overwritten the dominant narrative in the great American Merry-Go-Round.

And that trend continued with the rise of social media at a time when Conri was mostly just searching for ways to not socially Drown.

For he'd graduated with an undergrad degree in compsci from a Trench Coat area university, which is where he sustained a facial injury at the tender age of 20. Frown.

Like so, he'd worn more and more reality distortion like a Gown.

But then he started living life like Susie -- Spellbound!

So that her FashionText could become a data platform with its own pitcher's Mound.

As he'd always been on track to deliver the background Sound, ever since he'd started to feel lost and then Found.

For he'd became a graduate student at a Greater NY/C area U Town.

So that Classical, Big band, Island, International jazz, Club, Psychedelic, Rock 'n' roll, Glam rock, Heavy metal, Barking Hound, Grunge, Everything alternative, Social dance chic, Hip-hop rap artistry and all the more synthetic Pop -- that could I drop -- into my Eclectic Electronic Eye.

As journalism all the way Down and out in the street also became an act of remembering.

For me to keep on yearning and learning and burning like Susie, The: Proper Noun.

As I just wanna be Lounge-smiling like her.

For he's also taken to channeling Susie so often that her best ideas and attitudes became an effortless part of his real life too.

Because while writing her S2011 autobiography, TSFT, he experienced his own version of her march to shadow fame and real fortune which began in the early S90s.

As she created an original world-stage for people like us after she'd attended a Beyond the Pale area university.

And yet Susie's view of the world started spinning even faster in 'S08 when her most favored role model, Governor Fay Bobs, became everyone's President and Commander in Chief.

Via her secret Train Station Society, she was friends with everyone in the previous Republican administration too, vibing within their deep vein of authenticity that'd been previously hidden.

But moving right all along, he began narrating TheSusie books in 'S07 when he contributed fan fiction about Susie's role as TheSusie robot on the popular small screen spectacle, $X = a Reality Show About True Love.

And then she compiled the words of folks like him into a crowd-sourced living text online called "TheSusie.com Show" -- aka. TSS.

Susie 'so many TSSs' Alden also interviewed him about his experience working at "the hands-down hottest unicorn of the aughts: Suitsash" as part of her TripLeFT meta engineering project.

But with just a little help from their friends like Trey who'd attended an XYAxis Aligned area university, she got all of 'em to help ghostwriter her.

As I became her summarizer who vlogged the preceding "CH2: The Zyla Preface."

For TheSusie robot's grandest show yet was still outperforming as an LA-in-SI app for her social media news site, SharkInjury.

[Fig. 4 (Is this shark as tall as the cliffs, or is it a reality-sized shark that's flying to cliff height?)]

NOTE: we're pretending that this text was actually written by a fictional character named Todd who lives in a separate, parallel universe in which everyone assumes we're the fictional characters

And so we're prefixing dates from Susie's media universe with the letter S.

As that's what Todd could've done in order to avoid creating confusion.

For we also kept on using whimsical names like "a Beyond the Pale area university" or "an XYAxis Aligned area U" so that AI might one day write more and more fan fiction about, what?

[Fig. -4 (A selfie of Zyla that shows her first tattoo, "mybody idodim")]


__CH5: Trey's Memoir__

My writing within this Susie book is oxymoronic because I try to make reasonable statements about the practical details of my immediate life, only.

And that's not easy, but if more people would do that, then I digress.

For whenever everyone just does their own thing, then I agree with Susie that the world around us starts falling apart in accordance with various laws of nature.

As we're all mostly following directions of some kind that're often contradictory.

But then various people have also kept on seeking to add alignment in more and more dimensions of life.

And this I can support.

But the most enduring aspect of Susie's work became imagining a fictional character named Todd who could've written the same words that appeared in her "TSFT" memoir last year.

And yet Todd's life only has coincidental similarities to Conri's inner circle of advocates -- who he described in CH3 of this work.

Such that Susie wants to create another reality TV show with Pierre called "The Mad Susiest" in which teams of AI-content engineers compete to design and implement the best, "actual Susie robot."

Whereby Zyla's team on the show will start a comprehensive new tussle over belief with the fans of Phil's team.

But we can keep the rest private.

And in that way this show goes on...

[Fig. -3 (Zyla uses writing on her walls to explore "misunderstandings")]


__CH6: Todd's About__

There's a few million words in the journals that I've been developing since the turn of the millennium.

And a surprising percentage of those words talk about my experience of living with facial difference.

But even one million words is a lot, for what I wrote might not be wrong, as I'll keep writing.

[Fig. -2 (Todds: There are several versions of this photo grid of Todds)]
